=================
PREG functions for mysql
------------------------

lib_mysqludf_preg is a library of mysql UDFs (user-defined-functions)
that provide access to the PCRE (perl compatible-regular-expressions)
library for pattern matching. The PCRE library is a set of functions
that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same
syntax and semantics as Perl 5. This syntax can often handle more
complex expressions and capturing than standard regular expression
implementations. For more information about PCRE, please see:
http://www.pcre.org/.

lib_mysqludf_preg currently provides the following functions:  

`PREG_RLIKE( pattern , subject )` - test whether subject matches pattern,
which is a perl compatible regular expression.   

`PREG_CAPTURE(pattern, subject [, capture-group] [, occurence] )` - capture a 
named or numeric parenthesized subexpression from a pcre pattern.  Capture
from a specific match of the regex or the first match is occurence 
not specified.  

`PREG_CHECK( pattern )` - test whether the given pattern is a valid perl 
compatible regular expression.   

`PREG_POSITION(pattern, subject [, capture-group] [, occurence] )` - get the 
position in subject of a named or numeric parenthesized subexpression 
from a pcre pattern.  Capture from a specific match of the regex or 
the first match if occurence not specified.  

`PREG_REPLACE(pattern, replacement, subject [ ,limit ] )` - perform
a regular expression search and replace using a PCRE pattern.

`LIB_MYSQLUDF_PREG_INFO()` - obtain information about the currently installed
version of lib_mysqludf_preg. 



Some examples:
-------------
```SQL
SELECT captured, description FROM
    (SELECT PREG_CAPTURE( '/(new)\\\\s+([a-zA-Z]*)(.*)/i' , description, 2  ) as captured FROM state WHERE description LIKE 'new%') as t1
  WHERE captured IS NOT NULL;
```

```SQL
SELECT position, description FROM
    (SELECT PREG_POSITION( '/(new)\\\\s+([a-zA-Z]*)(.*)/i' , description, 2  ) as position FROM state WHERE description LIKE 'new%') as t1
  WHERE position IS NOT NULL;
```

```SQL
SELECT * from products WHERE PREG_RLIKE( '/hemp/i' , products.title )
```

```SQL
SELECT CONVERT( PREG_REPLACE( '/fox/i' , 'dog' , 'The brown fox' ) USING UTF8) as replaced;
```

Known Issues & Caveats
======================
- Version 1.2 respects mysqld stack limitations. This should reduce crashing, but you might need to set the thread_stack mysqld variable in order to accommodate some recursion intensive patterns.
- Version 1.1 changes the way NULLs are handled. To restore the legacy NULL handling, use configure --enable-legacy-nulls
- pcre_study should be used  (but isn't) for constant patterns;
- there is no localization or locale support
- some program locations that should be set in autoconf are not
- It would be nice if there were a persistent cache of compiled regexes
- It would also be nice if there were a peresistent cache of regex matches.
This would allow for a more efficient way of retrieving multiple matches than
repeated called with different 'occurence' arguments. 



When & When not to use these UDF's
==================================
These UDF's are useful in the following circumstances:
    - you already have pcre regex's that need to be applied in mysql
    - you need to use a more complex regex than is supported by RLIKE
    - you need to capture portions of a regex from mysql
    - you are looking for a slight performance improvement over RLIKE

For optimal performance, these (or any) UDF's should not be used:
    - as a replacement for a prefixed LIKE or RLIKE  (ie.  LIKE 'foo%')
    - as a replacement for MATCH .. AGAINST ... IN BOOLEAN MODE.
    - on large databases without other query constraints.  Often the PCRE (or
any function or UDF) can be used in conjunction with a fulltext index 
constraint in order to reduce the number of rows the need to be operated on.  
(ie. `SELECT PREG_CAPTURE ... WHERE MATCH AGAINST`)



Motivations & Explanations
==========================
-The 'occurence' argument to PREG_CAPTURE and PREG_POSITION was originally
thought not to be needed, since the {} notation in the regex itself
could be used.  For instance, /.{2}(.)/ could be used to get the
3rd character of a string.  This was found not to work for a 
large 'occurence'.  (ie.  /.{65536}(.)/)
