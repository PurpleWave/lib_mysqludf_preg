# This query can exceed the default stack limitations of the mysqld
# and requires that the thread_stack variable be set to 1M. This is left
# out of the automated tests so they don't fail when that variable is not
# big enough, but this query should be run by hand both with and without that
# variable set. 
#
# When it is NOT set, the mysqld should NOT crash. It should, however, 
# log an error message informing the user of the 'thread_stack' variable. 
# It will return NULL in that case. When the variable is big enough, this 
# will return a blank space.
